### 2. Confusion Matrix and Evaluation Metrics

Through the diagnosis test I predicted **100 reports as COVID positive**, but only **45 of those were actually positive**.
A total of **50 people in my sample were actually COVID positive**.
I have a total of **500 samples**.

Create a **confusion matrix** based on the above data and find:

I. Accuracy
II. Precision
III. Recall
IV. F-1 Score
