Dataset Link:
🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/venky73/temperatures-of-india
This dataset contains average monthly temperatures (°C) of India from 1901 onwards.
________________________________________
🧩 (a) Apply Linear Regression Model
________________________________________
🧠 Step 1: Import Libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, r2_score
Explanation:
We import all the necessary Python libraries:
•	pandas → for data loading and processing
•	numpy → for numerical operations
•	matplotlib & seaborn → for visualization
•	sklearn → for implementing and evaluating the linear regression model
________________________________________
🧠 Step 2: Load the Dataset
data = pd.read_csv("temperatures.csv")
print("First 5 rows of the dataset:\n")
print(data.head(), "\n")
Explanation:
We load the temperatures.csv dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
data.head() displays the first few rows to understand its structure (columns like YEAR, JAN, FEB, …, ANNUAL).
________________________________________
🧠 Step 3: Select Required Columns
X = data[['YEAR']]       # Independent variable
y = data['ANNUAL']       # Dependent variable
Explanation:
We define:
•	X (input feature) → Year (the predictor)
•	y (output/target) → Annual average temperature
This sets up our regression problem:
We want to predict temperature (y) from year (X).
________________________________________
🧠 Step 4: Create and Train the Linear Regression Model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
Explanation:
•	We create an instance of LinearRegression() from sklearn.
•	.fit(X, y) trains the model — it finds the best-fitting straight line through the data.
The model learns two important parameters:
•	Slope (m) → rate of temperature increase per year
•	Intercept (c) → estimated temperature when Year = 0
________________________________________
🧠 Step 5: Predict Annual Temperature
y_pred = model.predict(X)
Explanation:
We use the trained model to predict the annual temperatures for all years in the dataset.
These predicted values (y_pred) will later be used for performance evaluation and visualization.
________________________________________
🧩 (b) Assess Performance of Regression Model
________________________________________
🧠 Step 6: Evaluate Model Performance
mse = mean_squared_error(y, y_pred)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y, y_pred)

print("Model Performance Metrics:")
print(f"Mean Squared Error (MSE): {mse:.4f}")
print(f"Mean Absolute Error (MAE): {mae:.4f}")
print(f"R-Squared (R²): {r2:.4f}")
Explanation:
We calculate the following performance metrics to assess how well the model fits the data:
•	Mean Squared Error (MSE):
Average of squared differences between actual and predicted temperatures.
➤ Lower value = better accuracy.
•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
Average of absolute errors between actual and predicted temperatures.
➤ Tells how many °C the model is off, on average.
•	R² Score:
Proportion of variance in the temperature explained by the year.
➤ Closer to 1 means the model explains most of the data trend.
Example Output:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.3251  
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.4125  
R-Squared (R²): 0.85
Interpretation:
The model performs well because:
•	Errors (MSE, MAE) are small
•	R² = 0.85 → 85% of temperature variation is explained by the year
________________________________________
🧩 (c) Visualize the Simple Linear Regression Model
________________________________________
🧠 Step 7: Plot Actual vs Predicted Temperatures
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.scatterplot(x=X['YEAR'], y=y, color='blue', s=50, label='Actual Annual Temperature')
plt.plot(X, y_pred, color='red', linewidth=2, label='Regression Line')
plt.title("Yearly Temperature Trend in India (1901 - Present)", fontsize=14, weight='bold')
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("Annual Average Temperature (°C)")
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
Explanation:
•	Blue dots: Actual annual temperature values.
•	Red line: Predicted regression line from the model.
•	The upward slope of the red line shows a positive trend, meaning temperatures are increasing over the years.
This visualization clearly demonstrates the warming trend in India’s climate data.

🧩 (Optional) Future Temperature Prediction
________________________________________
🧠 Step 8: Predict Future Temperatures
future_years = pd.DataFrame({'YEAR': [2030, 2040, 2050]})
future_pred = model.predict(future_years)

print("\nPredicted Temperatures for Future Years:")
for yr, temp in zip(future_years['YEAR'], future_pred):
    print(f"Year {yr}: Predicted Temperature = {temp:.2f} °C")
Explanation:
We use the model to predict future annual temperatures for upcoming years (2030, 2040, 2050).
Example Output:
Year 2030: Predicted Temperature = 29.72 °C  
Year 2040: Predicted Temperature = 29.94 °C  
Year 2050: Predicted Temperature = 30.17 °C
Interpretation:
The predicted values continue to increase, showing that average temperatures are expected to rise in the future — consistent with global warming trends.
