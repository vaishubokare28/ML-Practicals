4. Assignment on Improving Performance of Classifier Models 

A SMS unsolicited mail (every now and then known as cell smartphone junk mail) is any junk message 
brought to a cellular phone as textual content messaging via the Short Message Service (SMS). Use 
probabilistic approach (Naive Bayes Classifier / Bayesian Network) to implement SMS Spam Filtering 
system. SMS messages are categorized as SPAM or HAM using features like length of message, word 
depend, unique keywords etc.

This dataset is composed by just one text file, where each line has the correct class followed by 
the raw message. 

a. Apply Data pre-processing (Label Encoding, Data Transformation….) techniques if 
necessary 
b. Perform data-preparation (Train-Test Split) 
c. Apply at least two Machine Learning Algorithms and Evaluate Models 
d. Apply Cross-Validation and Evaluate Models and compare performance. 
e. Apply Hyper parameter tuning and evaluate models and compare performance.
