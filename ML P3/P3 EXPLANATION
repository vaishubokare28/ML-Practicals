Classification Technique – Predicting Student Admission using Decision Tree
________________________________________
🎯 Objective:
The goal is to predict whether a student will get admission (Yes/No) based on their academic and research background such as GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, and Research Experience.
We will use a Decision Tree Classifier — a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks.

🧠 Step-by-Step Explanation
________________________________________
(A) Data Loading and Preprocessing
Purpose:
To load the dataset, clean it, and prepare it for modeling.
📌 Step 1: Import Libraries
We import necessary Python libraries:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
•	pandas/numpy → data handling
•	matplotlib/seaborn → data visualization
•	sklearn → machine learning utilities
________________________________________
📌 Step 2: Load the Dataset
data = pd.read_csv("Admission_Predict.csv")
print(data.head())
•	This loads the “Graduate Admissions” dataset from Kaggle.
•	The dataset has features like GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, etc.
________________________________________
📌 Step 3: Prepare the Target Column
data.rename(columns={'Chance of Admit ': 'Chance'}, inplace=True)
data['Admitted'] = data['Chance'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x >= 0.75 else 0)
data.drop('Chance', axis=1, inplace=True)
•	The dataset originally had a continuous “Chance of Admit” column (0 to 1).
•	We convert it into a binary target:
o	1 → Admitted (Chance ≥ 0.75)
o	0 → Not Admitted (Chance < 0.75)
________________________________________
📌 Step 4: Check Dataset Info & Missing Values
print(data.info())
print(data.isnull().sum())
•	Ensures all columns are numeric and there are no missing values.
________________________________________
📊 Step 5: Visualize Target Distribution
sns.countplot(x='Admitted', data=data)
plt.title("Admission Distribution (0 = No, 1 = Yes)")
plt.show()
•	Helps us see how many students were admitted vs. not admitted.
________________________________________
(B) Data Preparation (Train–Test Split)
Purpose:
To split the data so we can train the model on one part and test on another.
X = data[['GRE Score', 'TOEFL Score', 'University Rating', 'SOP', 'LOR ', 'CGPA', 'Research']]
y = data['Admitted']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
•	X (features): GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, etc.
•	y (target): Admitted (0 or 1)
•	train_test_split: Divides data into:
o	80% → Training set
o	20% → Testing set
________________________________________
(C) Applying the Decision Tree Classifier
Purpose:
To build and train a Decision Tree model that learns from training data.
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, plot_tree

dt_model = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy', random_state=42)
dt_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = dt_model.predict(X_test)
•	criterion='entropy' means we use Information Gain to decide splits.
•	The model learns patterns between input features and admission results.
________________________________________
🌳 Visualizing the Tree
plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))
plot_tree(dt_model, feature_names=X.columns, class_names=['No', 'Yes'], filled=True)
plt.title("Decision Tree for Student Admission Prediction")
plt.show()
•	This shows how the algorithm splits data at each node (e.g., CGPA ≥ 8.5, GRE ≥ 310, etc.)
•	Each leaf node represents a final decision: “Admitted” or “Not Admitted”.
________________________________________
(D) Evaluating the Model
Purpose:
To measure how well our model predicts unseen data.
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report, ConfusionMatrixDisplay

acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {acc*100:.2f}%")
✅ Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
________________________________________
📊 Confusion Matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=cm, display_labels=['Not Admitted', 'Admitted'])
disp.plot(cmap='YlGnBu')
plt.title("Confusion Matrix for Decision Tree Classifier")
plt.show()
•	True Positive (TP): Admitted → Predicted Admitted
•	True Negative (TN): Not Admitted → Predicted Not Admitted
•	False Positive / Negative: Model mistakes
________________________________________
🧾 Classification Report
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
Shows:
•	Precision: Accuracy of positive predictions
•	Recall: How many actual admissions were correctly found
•	F1-Score: Harmonic mean of Precision & Recall
________________________________________

•	Confusion Matrix: Shows correct vs. incorrect classifications.
•	Decision Tree Plot: Explains which features (e.g., CGPA, GRE, Research) influenced the prediction.
________________________________________
✅ Conclusion
•	The Decision Tree Classifier achieved around 90–91% accuracy, meaning it’s a reliable model for predicting student admissions.
•	Key influential features were CGPA, GRE Score, and Research Experience.
•	Counselors can use this model to estimate chances of admission quickly.
•	Future improvements:
o	Use Random Forest (ensemble method) for higher accuracy
o	Try feature scaling or pruning to reduce overfitting

🗣️ How to Explain in Viva / Practical Exam
“I used a Decision Tree Classifier to predict student admission based on GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, and research experience.
First, I cleaned and preprocessed the data, then split it into training and testing sets.
The Decision Tree model was trained using the entropy criterion and achieved about 91% accuracy.
The visualization shows how academic factors influence admission decisions.
Overall, the model performs well and could help universities or counselors make better admission predictions.”

🔹 2. What type of machine learning problem is this?
👉 It is a classification problem, because the output variable (Admitted) has two classes — Yes (1) or No (0).

•	Used seaborn and matplotlib for graphs
•	Plotted Confusion Matrix for performance
________________________________________
🔹 18. What is overfitting in Decision Trees?
👉 When the model learns the training data too well (including noise), it performs poorly on new, unseen data.
________________________________________
🔹 19. Why did you choose accuracy as a metric?
👉 Because the data is fairly balanced (almost equal admitted vs. not admitted cases), so accuracy is a reliable performance indicator.
________________________________________

•	The Decision Tree Classifier predicts admissions with ~91% accuracy.
•	CGPA and GRE are key predictors.
•	The model can help counselors or universities estimate student admission chances.
